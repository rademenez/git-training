NEXT TIME
---------
* Publish it on GitHub!!!
* The more you use this presentation the better
* Maybe it's better to grow organically, to improve this training presentation a bit by bit in your spare time, not just two weeks before training, too much work piles up if presentation must be prepared 2 weeks before training
* Move all info to English

LESSONS
